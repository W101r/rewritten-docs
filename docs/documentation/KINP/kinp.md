Kingsisle does not use an unfamiliar system found in MMO titles. Every client sends a message corresponding to an action rapidly to the server. The server calculations based on the received data, and approves or denies the request.

Kingisle's implementation of such system is labeled as __KingsIsle Networking Protocol__, or (__KINP__).
